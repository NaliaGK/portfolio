## Projects
### Indonesian Instagram Fake Followers Analysis Using HDBSCAN Clustering Method

Conducted thesis research on clustering fake follower accounts on Instagram in Indonesia, using HDBSCAN to identify dominant fake follower characteristics with effective machine learning performance. The formation of clusters using the HDBSCAN method achieved high performance with a Silhouette Index value of 0,77, a Davis-Bouldin Index of 0,34, and a Density-Based Clustering Validation value of 0,71. The HDBSCAN model results indicate that clusters characterized by the user's default  profile picture, a low number of words in the bio, the number of accounts that include links, the number of posts, the average length of descriptions, and the use of formal Indonesian words indicate a fake follower account. Additionally, it was found that the features of biography and post description text did not significantly impact the clustering results of Indonesian Instagram accounts.

### Surabaya Rainfall Prediction

![Rain intensity each month 2019-2021](/assets/images/rainfall2.png)

Developed a machine learning model to predict daily rainfall intensity in Surabaya, identifying that factors such as evening humidity, prior dayâ€™s rain or thunder events, and 24-hour humidity significantly impact the predictions. Using Random Forest, the model achieved an accuracy of 77% for rainfall intensity classification. Additionally, an XGBoost model effectively predicted light rain days but was less accurate with moderate to heavy rainfall. Overall, the model explained 32.8% of the variance in next-day rainfall, providing valuable insights for enhancing local weather forecasting and resource planning.

Contributed in the development of a WebApp for summarization and sentiment analysis on news articles from Kompas, a popular Indonesian news platform. This tool addresses user experience challenges on the site, such as ad-heavy layouts, by providing readers with concise summaries and sentiment insights. The app employs mT5 for text summarization, chosen for its proficiency in handling sequential data. For sentiment analysis, MultinomialNB, SVM, and Logistic Regression models were utilized to enhance accuracy through consensus. For example, if SVM and MultinomialNB were positive while LR was negative, the result defaults to positive. SVM delivered the highest sentiment accuracy at 97%, followed by LR at 95% and MultinomialNB at 90%.

### [TweeToxicity](https://github.com/Neek0tine/Tweetoxicity)

Contributed to the development of TweeToxicity, a web application designed to analyze Twitter user behavior by scoring tweets and retweets with machine learning, focused on building the front end, utilizing Bootstrap CSS and Bootstrap Studio to create a responsive, dynamic interface that adapts seamlessly across devices. The app retrieves user data via the Twitter API, with a backup scraping option through the Requests module for reliability. This educational tool provides users with insights into their social media interactions, promoting awareness and reflection on digital behavior.
